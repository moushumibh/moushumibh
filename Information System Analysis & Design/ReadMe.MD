### Jan 2020 â€“ Mar 2020

Project descriptionProvee Mobile Marketplace is a web-based online marketplace where service seekers and service providers meet. 
It is a one-stop store for all service needs like house cleaning, appliance repair, packer & movers, beauty & wellness, car wash,
professional services etc. The business model goes beyond search and suggestion platforms. It is an end-to-end solution for recruiting 
and enrolling verified service professionals, handling customer bookings, payments, and cancellations while not compromising quality control, 
thereby administering standardized services and quotes on a single platform. Customers can book a service, make payments, and rate services 
after the service has been offered. Partner/ Service Providers enroll on the application to get help with lead generation. Based on ratings 
and reviews, service providers get a continuous supply of customers and customers can book service professionals as and when needed. Customer 
subscription, fixed charges, and revenue sharing model make the organization sustainable.
